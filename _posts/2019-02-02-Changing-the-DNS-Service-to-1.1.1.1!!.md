The DNS resolvers play a major role in the speed of internet. The better ones are the ones which does everything in a shorter period of time. The [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) claims to be the best. 

But thats not the only thing which got my eyes. They claim that they provide 100% privacy which may raise some eyebrows.

## Privacy? What? ðŸ¤”

Yeah, the official [cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/) claims to be privacy first DNS resolver. Privacy and censorship has been a huge issue nowadays.

The privacy can be a huge issue as it can be used for a tool for censorship and even some of the ISPs are said to be selling the data of their users which is kind of creepy. So these DNS resolvers can be used to certain limit to avoid these issues.

## Speed? ðŸ˜•

According to the [official website](http://1.1.1.1) they are said to be better than many of the other prominent players. Just like me many had different opinion about this finding.

After googling alot this [blog post](https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5) caught my eyes. This one neatly explains the speed differences and other important nerdy stats like DNSCrypt, DNSeverHTTPS etc.

So I thought to give it a try.


## Setting it Up ðŸ”©

Its very easy to setup in your device. Depending upon your connection we have to set up it accordingly.

### For Computers ðŸ’» (Configuring Wifi)

For most of the computers, you just need to change the DNS from the advanced menu settings. Add the below to avoid any redundancy and conflicts. Its for both IPv4 and IPv6.


	1.1.1.1	
	1.0.0.1
    2606:4700:4700::1111
	2606:4700:4700::1001 	

You can configure your Mac like the screenshot below.

### For Mobile Devices ðŸ“±

For Mobile devices they have an app which has the VPN features and uses their DNS instead. So it is helpful in places like India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ where the majority of the people rely upon the mobile data over WIFI for the internet.


## My Thoughts ðŸ¤ 

I configured my Wifi settings and I noticed slight increase in loading time, after I type some web address and hit enter. 

These are not so noticeable like they claim for me as such, but there is some improvement, thats for sure! But slight speed improvements along with privacy do matter sometimes ðŸ˜Ž.
