I recently started to learn Ruby and I was really interested in the simplicity and powerfulness of this language. Well, I am not here to boast about the splendid features of ruby.  So let move on to the Scholarship part.

It's during that time I heard about RubyConfIndia, the annual Ruby Conference. I googled it and found that last time it was held in Kochi, the place where I was studying. And the most interesting thing I noticed was that it had a rich list of speakers and dignitaries that included the creator of Ruby, [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz "Yukihiro Matsumoto Twitter"), himself.

So I decided to give a try. I decided to apply for the Student Scholarship which covered the Conference ticket and travel costs. I applied with a small project in my GitHub account which I did to learn Ruby on Rails previously. To be frank, I didn't put much effort in filling up my Github account with Ruby projects. I just applied because it was a cool one. That's it. I didn't even think about it after applying.

### Jan 1, 2018

On this day, I got an email from [Satish Talim Sir](https://twitter.com/indianguru) saying that I have been selected as a Student Scholar along with the conference ticket link.

Wow !!  I couldn't believe it. I read the mail again and again. I (kind of) had goosebumps. I told my parents and friends. This may not be a big deal, but as it was my first, I had a reason to celebrate.

### Feb 9, 2018 - Conference Day 1

I reached Bangalore the previous day and I had enough time to reach the venue on time. I registered and was super excited. I met many people and that was the best thing I did in that two days.

The conference had good keynotes from all speakers. And even though I couldn't get everything from them I understood one thing, they were **the best** in their fields.

In between the breaks I met Avdi Grimm, Zach Holman, Elle Meredith and her cute lil baby, Hari Shankar, Aboobacker MK, Balasankar C, Tony Vincent and many others. I also met with my fellow student scholars and other student scholars from Kerala. It was a super good experience.

And like Harishankar quoted out _"We are not going to learn anything big in ruby in these two days, So Just go out and meet people"_. 
I was super shy and it was Balashankar helped me out. Thanks, Balu Chetta!


### Feb 10, 2018 - Conference Day 2

The second day commenced and without much hiccups, everything went nice. One thing that stood out was the keynote given by Zach.

Zach Holman, he was the best and no wonder he is known for his talks and puns. I still remember and it was one of the best talks I've heard without getting bored. His slides were so cool and colourful.

The second and the final day ended and it was time to depart. It was the sad part. It was the best conference I've attended so far. I was happy that I got a community with whom I could talk ruby with a cup of tea.
