  <p>I recently started to learn ruby and I was really interested in the simplicity and powerfulness of this language. Well, I am not here to boast about the splendid features of ruby.  So let move on to the Scholarship part.</p>

<p>Its during that time I heard about RubyConfIndia, the annual Ruby Conference. I googled about it and found that last time it was held in Kochi, the place where I was studying. And the most interesting thing I noticed was that it had a rich list of speakers and dignitaries that included the creator of ruby, <a href="https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz" title="Yukihiro Matsumoto Twitter">Yukihiro Matsumoto</a>, himself.</p>

<p>So I decided to give a try. I decided to apply for the Student Scholarship which covered the Conference ticket and travel costs. I applied with a small project in my github account which I did to learn Ruby on Rails previously. To be frank, I didn’t put much effort in filling up my Github account with ruby projects. I just applied because it was a cool one. Thats it. I didn’t even think about it after applying.</p>

<h3 id="jan-1-2018">Jan 1, 2018</h3>

<p>On this day, I got an email from <a href="https://twitter.com/indianguru">Satish Talim Sir</a> saying that I have been selected as a Student Scholar along with the conference ticket link.</p>

<p>Wow !!  I couldn’t believe it. I read the mail again and again. I (kind of) had a goosebumps. I told my parents and friends. This may not be a big deal, but as it was my first, I had a reason to celebrate.</p>

<h3 id="feb-9-2018---conference-day-1">Feb 9, 2018 - Conference Day 1</h3>

<p>I reached Bangalore the previous day and I had enough time to reach the venur on time. I registered and was super excited. I met many people and that was the best thing I did in that two days.</p>

<p>The conference had good keynotes from all speakers. And even though I couldn’t get everything from them I understood one thing, they were <strong>the best</strong> in their fields.</p>

<p>In between the breaks I met Avdi Grimm, Zach Holman, Elle Meredith and her cute lil baby, Harshankar, Aboobacker MK, Balashnkar C, Tony Vincent and many others. I also met with my fellow student scholars and other student scholars from Kerala. It was super good experience.</p>

<p>And like Harishankar quoted out <em>“We are not going to learn any thing big in ruby in these two days, So Just go out and meet people”</em>. 
I was super shy and it was Balashankar helped me out. Thanks Balu Chetta!</p>

<h3 id="feb-10-2018---conference-day-2">Feb 10, 2018 - Conference Day 2</h3>

<p>The second day commenced and without much hickups everything went nice. One thing that stood out was the keynote given by Zach.</p>

<p>Zach Holman, he was the best and no wonder he is known for his talks and puns. I still remember and it was one of the best talks I’ve heard without getting bored. His slides were so cool and colorful.</p>

<p>The second and the final day ended and it was time to depart. It was the sad part. It was the best conference I’ve attended so far. I was happy that I got a community with whom I could talk ruby with a cup of tea.</p>
