<meta name="description" content="Adding Custom Fonts for BloggerCustom fonts are vastly available which can be added to a site to make it more unique .There are numerous methods to embed fonts to a blog/ website ,from which several of them are paid services like Typekit &amp; Google Webfonts.With the help of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) you can easily add custom font to your blog/website.This is made possible with @font-face expression.Today we will be going through different Typography(font styling) and How to implement those on your blogger blogs.Things to Know Before You StartFirst of all lets go through the different types of fonts that are widely used today.They are as follows TTF For almost all browsers except Internet Explorer and iPhone Browser EOT For Internet Explorer only SVG For Apple Products like&nbsp; iPhone/iPod/iPad. WOFF Normally Compressed type ,for emerging standards By Embedding fonts in these formats would make your custom font visible clearly without the Flash of Unstyled Text(FOUT) issue.FOUT issue happens when our fonts are not cross browser compatible or even happens when the users Internet connection is too slow.Don&#39;t worry too much about it now as we will be solving this problem later in this post .Do you haveFOUT Isuue ??Why to Use Your own Custom Fonts in BloggerNote : If You are using Wordpress Blogs Read This Tutorial by Matt Russell.We Know that Blogger Provides Custom fonts in the Template Designer,but those are default fonts(Yes Of course it is beautiful )and all who use Blogger can add it too.So to make our Blog bit more unique we need a different style of Typography for your blogger blog .This will take your blog to a step higher.Lets BeginThis tutorial will be a bit long as we are going through almost all steps in detailed.So grab a cup of coffee and start reading this stuff and be prepared to rock your Blog !!! Before we begin take a look at the Screenshot below .This one is taken before I applied the Custom Font (Too boring !!!).We will be redesigning it to make it more Unique and Stylish.Really Awkward Isn&#39; it ???Step 0. Backup Your TemplateIt is very important to back up your template .This would help you to Undo changes even if anything goes wrong.Step 1. Select or Download A Font From The Collection&nbsp;This step (Selecting&nbsp; Fonts )must be taken with due Care as fonts can be copyright protected.Please do check twice whether they are having commercial / Personal licences.Normally Commercial licenses are a must to use those fonts in your Blogs.Here are some links where you can find hundreds of fonts.Dafont Fontsquirrel Urbanfonts Download it .Most probably it will be in OTF or in TTF format.Step 2. Convert The Downloaded Font to @Font-Face KitConvert &amp; Download Your Font KitAs we know the main step is to convert the downloaded fonts to different formats with @font-face kit.You just need to upload it to one of the following services and which they will convert it into different formats.After conversion you can download the kit.Fontsquirrels(Recommended)Font2web Note that the kit will contain 4 formats of fonts(inside the fonts folder) , a CSS stylesheet &amp; an index.html file.Step 3. Upload fonts to the server /&nbsp;Dropbox&nbsp;Upload the fonts to ServerIn this step we will be uploading the fonts (4 formats) to server.It is necessary to upload to a server or else others wont have access to view it.Since we are using Blogger we do not have access to Google Servers .So we need to upload it your own server(or cloud services).I prefer&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropbox&nbsp;as it is more reliable and User friendly.(Of course you can use other services too ,But remember that we need the public link with extension ,say your_font.ttf which you can easily obtain from dropbox)If you are going to use&nbsp;Dropbox,&nbsp;just upload it to&nbsp;Public folder(Link)&nbsp;.You need to copy the&nbsp;Public URL&#39;s of all 4 fonts&nbsp;and copy it to a place ,say a notepad file as we need it in our next step .Step 4. Edit Source Location -You &nbsp;need to Change URL of all 4 fonts (Click to Enlarge )You need to alter all the Source location Url &nbsp;in the CSS&nbsp; to the location where you have uploaded it.You need to edit the .woff,.ttf,.svg &amp;.otf&nbsp;source location with your Public Links.Step 5.Add that Edited CSS Code to Blogger template&nbsp;You can add that CSS code by going to the Blogger-&gt;Template-&gt;Edit Html and Add CSS Code just above ]]&gt;&lt;/b:skin&gt; and Save it. Step 6. Declare the Custom Font using CSS -In this part you want to apply the Fonts to wherever you want .Most preferred places many people use custom fonts are in the titles and post body .Post Title - For Using these font in Post Title&nbsp; Edit &nbsp;your_font name with your custom font name&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the edited CSS Code just above ]]&gt;&lt;/b:skin&gt; and Save it..post-title { font-family: Your_font; /* no need of Exensions like .svg , .ttf ,.otf */}Post Body - For Using these font in Post Body Edit&nbsp;your_font name with your custom font name and&nbsp; Add the edited CSS Code just above ]]&gt;&lt;/b:skin&gt; and Save it..post-body,.post { font-family: Your_font; /* no need of Exensions like .svg , .ttf ,.otf */}Step 7. Define Back-Up Fonts (Optional but Recommended to avoid FOUT)&nbsp;We create a simple back up for Your custom with other fonts so that even if one has slow connection and if the font doesn&#39;t load ,He/ She can see the Back up of the fonts.It is very Easy to add.You just need to extend your font-family declaration with some fonts and comas..You can see the example here.Post Title.post-title {font-family: &#39;Your_font&#39;,Verdana,sans-serif; /* Here also Verdana,sans-serif are added as Back up */}Post Body.post-body,.post {font-family: &#39;Your_font&#39;,Verdana,sans-serif; /* Here Verdana,sans-serif are added as Back up */}Step 8.Check your WebsiteWow !! It changed my blog entirely ...That&#39;s All !! You are done .Just Preview Your Blog before saving and if it works Save it or else double check the codes ,Url&#39;s etc .Even if it again goes wrong feel free to comment your queryRelated LinksCheck the fonts which are&nbsp; available for embeddingRelated article by Paul IrishFor Wordpress Blogs Read This TutorialFighting FOUT with Paul IrishI hope this tutorial helped you a lot .Do you have any other methods for adding custom fonts ?

Fonts )must be taken with due Care as fonts can be copyright protected.Please do check twice whether they are having commercial / Personal licences.Normally Commercial licenses are a must to use those fonts in your Blogs.<br /><br />Here are some links where you can find hundreds of fonts.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.dafont.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dafont</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fontsquirrel</a> </li><li><a href="http://www.urbanfonts.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Urbanfonts</a> </li></ul>Download it .Most probably it will be in OTF or in TTF format.<br /><br /><strong><span style="background-color: #ffd966;">Step 2.</span> Convert The Downloaded Font to @Font-Face Kit</strong><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-svSoxm_h-Vs/UYIMggFs5mI/AAAAAAAABl0/FLmwOQteVs0/s1600/Download+Your+Kit.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

Download Your Font Kit</td></tr></tbody></table><strong></strong>As we know the main step is to convert the downloaded fonts to different formats with @font-face kit.You just need to upload it to one of the following services and which they will convert it into different formats.After conversion you can download the kit<strong>.</strong><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fontsquirrels</a>(Recommended)</li><li><a href="http://font2web.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Font2web</a> </li></ul><strong>Note</strong> that the kit will contain 4 formats of fonts(inside the fonts folder) , a CSS stylesheet &amp; an index.html file.<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="background-color: #ffd966;">Step 3.</span> Upload fonts to the server /&nbsp;<a href="http://db.tt/g9w98Nrg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;</strong><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Edit &nbsp;<code>your_font</code> name with your custom font name&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the edited CSS Code just above <code>]]&gt;&lt;/b:skin&gt;</code> and Save it.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">.post-title {<br /> font-family: Your_font;
