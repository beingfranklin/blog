<meta name="description" content="Blogging has always been a hobby, moreover a passion, for me. This passion kept growing from time to time and finally I have reached here. Distractions!!!!!!!Blogging with a clear head and mind is always essential to get most out of you. Everyone don&#39;t have the talent to write by birth. I am one among them. That doesn&#39;t mean that those people should not write. Instead they should focus more and more on their weaknesses.Main Cause – DistractionGetting distracted while writing is very common. But avoiding it is the hard task.You cannot always get rid of it.So its better to avoid such situations.Sometimes the Blog editor also play such a role in distracting you. Here comes the importance of the neat and clean yet powerful blog editor.Finding a way..I read many blogs talking about these issues and writers block that they experience due to it. All of them pointed towards many tools. But most of them had their hands towards the John Saddington&#39;s&nbsp; Desk App.Desk App with Multiple Platform Integration.I searched for it in detailed and found the sad part that it was only available for Mac OS X.It had all the cool features for a distraction free ambience for bloggers. It has got all the features needed but is not clumsy as other blog editors.It has got multiple platform integration and you can post even to Evernote Its simple user friendly interface has gathered a lot of attention. It even helped them to become the best App award twice in a row.But How is that Gonna Help Me???I am a Windows user and I cant use it :( .After a long search ,a very long one indeed, i found an alternative solution.I was a regular user of windows live writer ,now Open Live writer . But these apps have its own kind of distraction to offer. Recently I came to notice that Hemingway Editor also has a similar, clean and neat interface . Actually this Hemingway editor is for polishing your writing and is not for blogging. This tool is for showing the readability and user friendliness. Its available both as a Web App and Desktop Application (Paid).This App is Surely Distraction FreeAfter seeing its UI , I right away installed Desktop App on my PC. Found my &quot;Windows User&quot; Solution By Now you may have already got what I did...Hemmingway App + Open Live Writer = Voila !!Yeah, I used Hemmingway app to draft my post and OLW to publish it after modification.So it helped me to boost my posts&#39; readability and provided me with clutter free experience.Final ThoughtsHoping that Desk brings us the windows version soon . Even Hemmingway App having integration with various platforms can be helpful.Got any other tools in your list? Feel free to share it in the comments below.Happy Blogging :) .Photo credits&nbsp;" />
