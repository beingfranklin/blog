<meta name="description" content="Bounce rates are often considered as one of the key point in determining your website’s/blogs ranking. In simple words, Bounce rate tells you how much time people spend on your website. Less Bounce rate means people leaving your website less.Obviously a great amount of work is required to bring back your readers to your circle.More readers always means more conversion.&nbsp;Here are few tips to help you to reduce your sites bounce rate based upon my experience.#1. Landing page with Better User (Oriented) Experience –UX/UI Your landing page matters the most.Yes you heard it right. Over the past few years it has been a trend that the content quality is not the only factor that determines the ranking and design also matters.Investing in good design not only gains the attention but its also proven that it increases&nbsp;conversion&nbsp;rates.Many people face it difficult to choose a perfect design and always need a tailor made designs.For that case i suggest you to hire good Designers and the cost you spend on it is never a waste.These agencies nowadays also helps in your User Interface tweaks and gives User (Centric) analysis .And as always Good design gets good attention. And Google want you to serve people not bots !#2. Promising (not Killer) Call to ActionIf You want to convert your readers into loyal readers and again loyal readers into your customers. Then you have to do this call to action. You have to give them an offer or service and make it so compelling that it leads to sales.Promising Call to Action should serve its purpose and should not be a fraud ,as it will adversely affect your blog’s /Websites traffic.Killer Call to Action Banners or Buttons can be compelling.But do&nbsp;think&nbsp;twice.Can you deliver them&nbsp;always those killer content always? If your answer is a No ,please keep it simple and accurate .So your readers wont be&nbsp;disappointed.#3. Load it Faster (with no or less pop ups)Good Design with faster content delivery also is a must. And Search engines prefer Responsive Websites. &nbsp;Reduce the loading time considerably by&nbsp;avoiding&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp; bulky image files ,java scripts&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;Always try to build websites that use minimum amount of data. Because data usage can also be a deciding factor.Avoid Using POP-UPs .Although&nbsp;those can help us to get quick attention from our readers.It can also &nbsp;lead to increased bounce rates.So I&nbsp;strongly recommend&nbsp;to avoid using POP-UPs as they are really annoying.&nbsp;P.S. Many of our readers pointed out that giant blogging websites use them to advertise or as&nbsp;their Call to&nbsp;Action Banners.Yes ,you said it .Its because&nbsp;their&nbsp;site/blog has got huge readership and&nbsp;&nbsp;they already have their trusts.So there is less to worry about.#4. Choose Your Keywords Accurately&nbsp;Proper keyword research is a must before you do the above steps.You should have detailed idea about your topic/niche and the group of readers you target.Narrowing your target helps you to serve them with right dish with right recipe.Most of the people thimk that injecting money making keywords into their site gives them good rankings.Its Absolutely Wrong !!Keywords with relevance scores here.When you consider top blogs and their keywords used,they always gave importance to most suiting and relevant keywords rather than choosing a pile of high traffic keywords.Always keep in mind &quot;Low Traffic Relevant&nbsp;Keywords Gives you more than high Traffic&nbsp;Irrelevant&nbsp;ones&quot;.&nbsp;#5. Offer them a reason to come backIf you want your readers to come back and visit your site again offer them perfect reason for it.Quality !!!.Yeah.
