We all know FB categorizes all things and they do that on the images also.But here either the bot got wrong or the category to which the following image put is wrong.The image below is the villain here.Here this image has categorized under&nbsp;SEXUALY EXPLICIT content.&nbsp;We all get spam messages from our friends and we do often fall for it.But in those cases there was legitimate reasons which stood against us.But in this case its not like that.The picture shown (a kiddo with fish.) was sent in Facebook by few of my friends and within few minutes they were banned for 72 hours!!!!I don&#39;t know whats wrong with this picture. I did an reverse image search and ít didnt give me much answer except leading into a meme website. But as i mentioned above it may have caused because the categorization went wrong or there is a serious flaw in their algorithm which they should rectify ASAP.&nbsp;" />
