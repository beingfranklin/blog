<meta name="description" content="I had experienced an unusual problem/bug in my Sony Xperia Z. It was one of the craziest thing I had experienced. The Bug was Media Files Didn&#39;t have Audio InputEarpieces got disabled/didnt work during phone calls. Each time I had to connect to an earpiece or put it in Loudspeaker to&nbsp; continue with the phone calls.The Videos Recorded didnt have an audio… etc &lt;p&gt;I was sure that it wasn’t a hardware issue because during diagnostics it all seemed working perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat browsing and posting about this bug for about 3 months ,but sadly I couldn’t find proper answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of them pointed to few common solutions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard Reset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uninstalling Recently Installed Apps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rooting Your Phone .. etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had done the first two ,but couldnt do the latter one (As my phone’s Bootloader was Locked it was risky to do and it may even lead to Brick). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I Solved it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I installed few Apps.
